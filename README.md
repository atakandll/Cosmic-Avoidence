## Game Details 
- In this game, we complete the levels by escaping from meteors and enemy ships in space with our spaceship. We have a mini boss every 2 levels and a main boss in the last level.

- There are 7 different enemies in total in the game.
    - `Green enemy:` It was done to distract and make it difficult. It just falls down and hits the player, damaging it.
    - `Meteors:` There are 3 different meteors and each of them has different size, speed and damage.
    - `Purple enemy:` It fires 2 shots and is pretty fast.
    - `Red space ship:` It fires 3 times and has almost the same mechanics as the purple enemy.
    - `Satellite enemy:` The enemy with the slowest and most health requires a lot of shooting to kill it and increases the difficulty by taking up a lot of space.
    -  `Mini boss:` It appears every 2 levels and has 2 phases. In the 1st phase, it fires with classic random moves, and in the 2nd phase, it produces a sphere and the bullets from the sphere scatter around and damage the player.
    -  `Boss:` It works on the same logic as the mini boss, but it is bigger, stronger and much harder to kill.

# PowerUp system
- There are items in the game that will help us survive longer in 3 different games.
- These spawn randomly when we kill meteors and some enemies.
  
- `Heal:` Heal the player a little.   
- `Shoot:` A feature that can be upgraded to fire more than 4 times. When we first collect, we fire 2 fires, 3 fires and finally 4 fires.
- `Shield:` When we collect it, a shield surrounds us and this shield prevents us from taking damage from enemies and kills us if we hit them. The shield has 3 powers and can all be destroyed depending on the damage taken.

# Unity Ads
- I used Unity Ads for Google Play in the game and it was all integrated successfully. These are;
   - BannerAd
   - Interstitial Ad
   - Rewarded Ad
# Android Notification
- I have integrated a notification that will be sent to the player if he/she does not enter the game for more than 1 day.
